							<h2><a href="#">The Gang</h2>
							<p>We dub ourselves as "The Gang". We've been hiking together since freshman year of high school, and we all met through unlikely circumstance. Our first big hike was the Enchantments hike, a beautiful 20 mile hike through the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, which brought all of us closer together and created the foundation for crazy hikes to come in the future. </p>

						<p>This is our first photo together. I still vividly remember thethe spot we took this picture, and exactly how I propped up my Sony A6000 on a rock to grab the picture. Memories.</p>

									<p>I first met Jonny in AP Biology class. Always energetic and erratic, I was drawn to him in this weird way. He called me "Max" for the first month of him knowing me because he could never remember my name. We hit off in class and were very disruptive, he found out I rock climbed, and invited me to go hiking with him. And so I did and the rest is history. Our teacher hated us.</p>

									<p>I met Gannon through a mutual friend at a birthday party in 8th grade. Knew of him as a talented jazz pianist, and ended up seeing him again in high school and becoming friends with him. I went hiking with him and Jonny for the first time, and the rest is history.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Winston</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>I met Winston through a different mutual friend and went climbing with him one time as well as seeing him at jazz competitions. We immediately hit off on one of my first hikes with the gang. The rest is history.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Ethan</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>I met Ethan in kindergarten at Grand Ridge Elementary in Issaquah. He ended up moving away to Bellevue, and then my family also moved to Bellevue a about 5 years later. I saw him again in middle school and started hiking with him after college. The rest is history.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Aaron</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>I met Aaron through a hike with The Gang and was always entertained by his humor and personality. The rest was history. Haven't really seen him in recent years but I know he's doing well.</p>
